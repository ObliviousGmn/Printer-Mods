## -+- SB Carriage Hex Nut Mod

I got tired of the StealthBurner Carriage Heatsets failing time after time. With time they tend to pull out from exposure to heat.
So I replaced it with M3 Captive Hex Nuts. I decided to move them a further back, To give them more surface tension. So instead of M3x50 screws.
I used M3x55.

Feedback is Welcomed!
